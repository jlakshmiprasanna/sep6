            </p>
            <p>-->New Form Elements and Input Types</p>
            <p>HTML4: Had basic form elements like input type, textarea, select</p>
            <p>HTML5: Added new input types like input type="email", input type="date",input type="range" and attributes
                like required,autofocus and placeholder.</p>
            <p>-->Depcated Elements and Attributes</p>
            <p>HTML4:Included many outdated or redundant elements like font, center, and attributes like align for
                styling.</p>
            <p>HTML5:Depcated many of these elements,pushing for the use of CSS for styling and layout.</p>
            <p>-->Canvas and SVG Support</p>
            <p>HTML4: Had limited support for drawing graphics; typically relied on images or external tools like Flash.
            </p>
            <p>HTML5: Introduced the canvas element for drawing graphics and animations directly in the browser, and
                also improved support for SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics).</p>
            <p><b>5.Drag and drop in hover?</b></p>

            <p>display:inline An element with a display property set to inline will not start on a new line and it will
                take up the remaining/available screen width.Because of this, you can't set the width and height of an
                element that has a display of inline.</p>
            <p><b>7.What is difference between float and text-align?</b></p>

                new HTML element into the markup, rather than applying a class to existing elements.</p>
            <p><b>9.What is box-model in css?</b></p>

            <p>Padding: It is used to give the space between the content and border.</p>
            <p><b>11.What is difference between position:relative and position:absolute?</b></p>
            <p>position:absolute: Positions an element based on the top and left margins of the page, relative to its
                closest positioned ancestor. This allows the element to be placed exactly where you want it, even on top
                of other elements.</p>
            <p>position:absolute: Positions an element relative to its original position within the parent element. This
                means that setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties will move the element away from its
                normal position.</p>
            <p><b>12.What is difference between position:fixed and position:sticky?</b></p>
            <p>position:fixed It mean fixed to the viewport. We tell it where to position itself (top, bottom, right, or

            <p>The animation-duration property specifies how long an animation takes to complete, in seconds or
                milliseconds. A value of 0s means no transition will occur, and the animation will switch between states
                instantly.</p>
            <p>The animation-timing-function property controls how an animation accelerates and decelerates during its
                cycle. This property affects how the user perceives the animation's speed, and can make an animation
                start slowly, accelerate, maintain a constant speed, or end instantly.</p>
